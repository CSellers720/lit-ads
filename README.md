Currently, the page displays all stored listings, which can be created and added by clicking the "Create a Listing" button in the top bar and following the instructions.

As things stand, the interface will validate and give you a preview of the listing, then loads them into the main page.

### ISSUES

I'm currently having problems getting the images to persist once the page is navigated away from. The listings are stored in a MongoDB Atlas cluster, but given the time constraints, I did not manage to get my images to persist. All of the other data will be stored and should be viewable even after navigating away from the page.
